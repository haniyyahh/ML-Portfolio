This is a portfolio with projects using R, Python, and Markdown

## Overview of Machine Learning
A link to the pdf for my Overview of Machine Learning document can be found [here](https://github.com/haniyyahh/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Overview_of_ML.pdf).

## C++ & R: Data Exploration
A link to the C++ program that reads the Boston.csv file and contains 6 functions to calculate the sum, mean, median, range, covariance, and correlation can be found [here](https://github.com/haniyyahh/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/data_exploration.cpp).

The documentation for this program can be found [here](https://github.com/haniyyahh/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Data_Exploration_Documentation.pdf).

## Linear Models
A link to the analysis of the number of Upvotes a post gets in relation to the user's reputation, total views, and total answers can be found [here](https://github.com/haniyyahh/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/linear_models_RNotebook.pdf). It utilizes a linear regression model.
A link to the analysis of the effect of different music genres on the popularity of songs can be found [here](https://github.com/haniyyahh/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/log_regression_naive_bayes_R_notebook.Rmd). It utilizes logistic regression and Naive Bayes models.
