# ML_Portfolio
This is a portfolio with projects using R, Python, and Markdown

## Overview of Machine Learning
A link to the pdf for my Overview of Machine Learning document can be found [here](https://github.com/haniyyahh/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Overview_of_ML.pdf).

## C++ & R: Data Exploration
A link to the C++ program that reads the Boston.csv file and contains 6 functions to calculate the sum, mean, median, range, covariance, and correlation can be found [here](https://github.com/haniyyahh/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/data_exploration.cpp).

The documentation for this program can be found [here](https://github.com/haniyyahh/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Data_Exploration_Documentation.pdf).

## Linear Models
A link to the analysis of the number of Upvotes a post gets in relation to the user's reputation, total views, and total answers can be found [here](https://github.com/haniyyahh/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/linear_regression_RNotebook.pdf). It utilizes a linear regression model.
A link to the analysis of the effect of different music genres on the popularity of songs can be found [here](https://github.com/haniyyahh/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Classification_RNotebook.pdf). It utilizes logistic regression and Naive Bayes models.

## ML Algorithms from Scratch
The link to the C++ file for Logistic Regression is [here](https://github.com/haniyyahh/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/MLScratch2.cpp).
The link to the C++ file for Naive Bayes is [here](https://github.com/haniyyahh/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/NaiveBayes.cpp).
The documentation for this component is [here](https://github.com/haniyyahh/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/ML%20Algorithms%20from%20Scratch%20Documentation.pdf).

The link to Notebook 2 is [here](https://github.com/haniyyahh/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Notebook2.pdf).
The link to Notebook 3 is [here](https://github.com/haniyyahh/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Notebook3-compressed.pdf).
The link to Notebook 4 is [here](https://github.com/haniyyahh/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Notebook4.pdf).
The link to the narrative discussing these similarity models, clustering methods, and dimensionality reduction techniques is [here](https://github.com/haniyyahh/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/ML_%20Searching%20for%20Similarity.pdf).

## Kernel and Ensemble Methods
The link to Notebook 1 is [here](https://github.com/haniyyahh/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/SVM_Regression_Notebook1.pdf).
The link to Notebook 2 is [here](https://github.com/haniyyahh/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Notebook2Classification.pdf).
The link to Notebook 3 is [here](https://github.com/haniyyahh/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Notebook3Ensemble.pdf).
The link to the narrative discussing SVM regression, classification, and the ensemble methods used in the notebooks is [here](https://github.com/haniyyahh/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Narrative%20-%20Kernel%20and%20Ensemble%20Methods.pdf).

## ML with skLearn
The link to the pdf which covers several different algorithms performing over the auto dataset including neural networks, is [here](https://github.com/haniyyahh/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/ml_with_skLearn.pdf).

## Image Classification
The link to the pdf is [here](https://github.com/haniyyahh/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/KerasImageClassification.pdf).
